**Drug overdose has emerged as a serious public health concern in the United States. In the past couple decades, more than 932,000 people have died due to drug overdose. Each year, the overdose deaths keep surpassing the total number that occurred the previous year. The recent surge in overdose deaths is driven by fentanyl which is involved in more than 50% of confirmed cases. Drug use and mortality continue to increase nationally and across Washington State. This wiki page focuses on the spatial distribution of fatal and non-fatal drug overdoses, and the availability of healthcare facilities at the county level in Washington State during the year 2021. To help spread awareness on drug overdose, this wiki page will present the patterns and effects of drug overdose. The use of geospatial data will help find the geographic disparities and underlying factors that contribute to this crisis. To provide insights into the patterns and effects occurring, three thematic maps are provided that examines the distribution of drug overdose fatalities, non-fatal hospitalizations, and the availability of healthcare resources across the state.**


## Map 1 | Fatal Drug Overdoses

*This map shows the spatial influences of fatal drug overdoses across counties in Washington State. It provides a visual representation on the problem that drug overdoses impose in specific areas and shows the regions with high concentrations of fatal overdoses. By examining the areas with different concentrations of fatal overdoses, a better understanding of the geographical disparities in this crisis is gained. Each county is color coded based on the count of fatal drug overdoses in 2021. Darker shades of blue indicate for higher death count, meaning these counties are experiencing higher fatalities due to drugs. The legend ranges from 0 to 649, providing a visual of the vast number of fatal drug overdoses across different counties. Taking a closer look at the visual, the areas with the highest concentrations of fatal drug overdoses are King, Pierce and Snohomish County, suggesting that these areas have the biggest overdose crisis. A factor that can potentially cause these counties to have a high counts of overdose rates is the distance to healthcare facilities in-order to receive proper treatment.*

## Map 2 | Non-Fatal Drug Overdoses

*This map shows the spatial influences of non-fatal drug overdose hospitalizations across counties in Washington State. It offers insight into the broader impact of drug overdoses on the healthcare system and focuses on areas where incidents place a strain on medical resources. Each county is color coded based on the count of non-fatal drug overdose hospitalizations in 2021. Darker shades of green indicate for higher hospitalization count, meaning these counties are experiencing higher frequency of individuals requiring hospitalization due to drug overdoses. The legend ranges from 0 to 1283, providing a visual of the vast number of non-fatal drug overdose hospitalizations across different counties. Taking a closer look at the visual, the areas with the highest concentrations of hospitalizations are King, Pierce and Snohomish County, suggesting that these areas have the biggest hospitalization crisis. Factors that can potentially cause these counties to have a high count of hospitalizations due to drug overdose is drug availability/accessibility, lack of access to treatment, substance use disorder, etc.*

## Map 3 | Hospitals

*This map displays the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities, specifically hospitals, across counties in Washington State. This visual helps with recognizing the link between the proximity of hospitals and drug overdose incidents and provides insights into the accessibility of healthcare resources, focusing on areas that face challenges in providing timely care to those affected by drug overdoses. Each county is color coded based on the number of hospitals available in 2021. Darker shades of red indicate for higher hospital count, meaning these counties have the most hospitals available compared to other areas. The legend ranges from 0 to 5, providing a visual of the number of hospitals across different counties. Taking a closer look at the visual, the areas with the highest concentrations of hospitals are King, Pierce and Snohomish County, suggesting that these areas have better access to healthcare resources. Areas with limited access to healthcare facilities and hospitals may face challenges in providing proper care to those affected by drug overdose.*
